                    Fitness enthusiasts often choose smartwatches to help them track their progress and goals while
                    working out. Smartwatches log data from your workouts and can be used to monitor your health over
                    time. By seeing your progress, you can stay motivated and on track to achieving your fitness goals.

                    A smartwatch can be a great tool to help you stay fit and healthy. By tracking your exercise and
                    activity levels, it can give you useful insights into your progress and how you can improve your
                    fitness. Additionally, many smartwatches come with apps that can provide suggestions on how to stay
                    fit and healthy. Sleep tracking is another popular feature that can help you identify patterns in
                    your sleep habits and make necessary changes to improve the quality of your sleep.

                <p>
                    According to an article from a few years back, over $3 billion is raised per year in the yoga
                    industry. As with any industry, growth tends to mean more products, and more products means more
                    choice. That’s where yoga technology comes in.
                    Yoga and technology are two utterly different things. Yoga is about listening to your body, freeing
                    your mind, and improving your internal state so that you look better on the outside. Technology is
                    all about convergence, doing things at a faster pace, better, and more efficiently. Is it possible
                    for yoga and technology to not just exist alongside each other, but to reinforce each other? As you
                    will see from yoga technology, the answer seems not only to be true, but that it’s an inevitable
                    phenomenon that has significant consequences for practice. As we’ll see, yoga and technology seem
                    almost inextricably linked.

                <p>
                    Body fat scales measure body fat by sending a tiny electrical impulse through your body from one
                    foot to the other and measuring the relative speed of it through your body (and yes, it's safe).
                    Some models include the ability to calculate your body mass index (BMI).
                    Body fat scales are easy to use. In fact, most models require you to stand on your feet to use them.
                    For example, you can use them before getting out of bed in the morning or after arriving home from
                    work.
                    You can use the numbers to determine whether you need more protein or calcium in your diet.
                    It is an advanced tool for measuring body fat percentage, which is most important for health and
                    well-being.
