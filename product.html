                    SmartifyHealth is a new and modern startup aiming to bring you closer to terms with health and sport
                    tech. We provide a monthly service for monitoring and analyzing your data, submitted by you to our
                    portal. Our specialists will analyze your work out trends as well as general health statistics to
                    deliver a set of work outs, diets and other goals directly to your smart devices. You can use any of
                    the
                    supported devices listed in our landing page, you can also choose to contact us through the contact
                    form
                    to inform us of a device you'd like us to add to our platform.

                <p>
                    Health is important, and qualitatively measuring it even more so. Our current competitors are tech
                    giants which sell your data to the highest bidder, while we are a group of board certified doctors
                    and health instructors with a passion. We provide full transparency about what happens to your data.
                    We want to help you measure and improve your health, not sell it.

                    It's easy to get started using our platform. First we ask you to download our mobile app which will

                    recommendations. You will need a subscription, we provide 3 plans, but do not worry, the 1st plan is
                    what most people will need due to it's wide coverage.
